## Modules Used

- `/Discord.js`: discord.js is a powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much  more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.
-`/Canvacord`: Easily generate images using react-like components in nodejs.
-`/MongoDB`: As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data.
-`/dotenv`: It allows you to create environment variables in a . env file instead of putting them in your code.
-`/server.js`: js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications.


## Future goals

- **spam detection**.
- **auto detect objectionable messages:** delete them and generate warning.
- **leaderboard:** shows accumulated points which has utility in challenges and duel between players.
